# ENGR101-2016
C code for controlling Raspberry Pi 2s in ENGR 101 during 2016

The purpose of this repository is to learn how to use github. Github is a place where you can store code and 
have snapshots of its history so that if anything goes wrong I am able to go back to older versions of the code.
